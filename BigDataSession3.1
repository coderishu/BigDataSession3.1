ResourceManager: a scheduler that allocates available resources in the cluster amongst the competing applications.

NodeManager: runs on each node in the cluster and takes direction from the ResourceManager. It is responsible, 
for managing resources available on a single node.

ApplicationMaster: an instance of a framework-specific library, an ApplicationMaster runs a specific 
YARN job and is responsible for negotiating resources from the
 ResourceManager and also working with the NodeManager to execute and monitor Containers.
The actual data processing occurs within the Containers executed by the ApplicationMaster. A Container grants rights to an application to use a 
specific amount of resources (memory, cpu etc.) on a specific host.
